# data-analytics-projects-r
Data analytics projects using R from MSc in Data Analytics. This project contains the main R dataset programming projects for use with basic R functions
and dataset visualizations. The data visualizations can be viewed directly on shinyapps.io.

## project summary by project week and R script filename

### week1-dicerolls.R
Initial introduction to R programming basic functions and data structures (vectors, variable assignment and so on). Also using seeding. 
It is a basic 2-dice rolling scenario and checks for values based on those rolls.

### week3-matrices.R
The goal is to produce a matrix of computer science modules, median student grade for those modules, 
and store the student obervations for those modules they attended in a matrix data structure in R.

### week4-dataframes-aggregate-functions.R
The goal is to experiment with dataframe structures and use aggregate functions in R. It uses guard conditions and uses the apply function.

### week5-ggplot-titanic-dataset-visualizations.R
The goal is to use the Titanic dataset and perform data visualizations using ggplot.

To view the data visualization plots, you can use this [PDF report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Alcoa8KLVJaoiLUm2-0Y72mJDnTzIw?e=dKAb40) version of the R script.

### week6-flights-dataset-dplyr.R
The goal is to use dplyr to analyze and filter data in the nycflights13 flights dataset.

### week7-energy-datasets-dplyr.R
The goal is to analyse two datasets - Ireland Energy Generation Data from 2017, Mace Head Wind Data from 2017.

### week8-string-text-processing.R
The goal is to perform text analysis using the string processing packages and the tidyverse package. Uses Ulysess Chapter 2 as the input dataset.

### week10-package/
The goal is to get accustomed to the process of creating our own package in R using simple Queue data structure and methods and perform test validation.
This version adds a bug fix for one of the test_that test cases that was failing due to invalid column reference and all tests now passing as of 2022.
