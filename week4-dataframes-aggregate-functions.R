# Assignment 4: Working with Dataframes
# Description: This assignment is focussed on using dataframe structures and
# aggregate functions in R.
# Name: Niall Guerin
# Student ID: 18235079

# configure dataframe variables
set.seed(1000)
ids <- rep(as.character(1001:1005,2))
module <- c(rep("CT101",5),rep("CT102",5))
result <- c(rnorm(n = 5,mean = 70,sd = 5),
            rnorm(n = 5,mean = 50,sd = 8))

# setup up data frame and apply NA rule from Johanna in Discussion Forum
result <- c(NA, result[2:length(result)])

# create the data frame and populate with variables values
dataf <- data.frame(ids, module, result)

# create aggregate function

# class and unique functions are permitted as general guideline
# use unique to extract the row subsets in the main output steps (3 and 4)
# use class for validation step
# as per original objective do not use for loops: use apply instead per Jim and Joanna's best practices in discussion forums
# used apply but it is not as optimal as way it is shown in challenge sheets e.g. mtcars from lecture sessions.

      # to time and was getting errors trying to use various tricks on an overall new dataframe which had just ids/result column.
      # my workaround uses a utility helper function that calculates the mean depending on whether the aggregate function is
      # called with na.rm = True or not specified (i.e. R default of False) and allows for null arglist as well on aggregate function
      # technically I could calculate mean below also by not setting drop=F (use that to avoid data errors I hit when not using drop=F) and doing mean just on result vector. I opted for
      # apply to force myself into habit of using it as I was not using it fully in last matrix assignment either and need to
      # play around with it more so that is only reason I enforced drop=F and use of apply here. I can use apply more easily
      # on scenarios like mtcars but found I kept getting errors when trying that on a subset dataframe here with particular
      # rows based on ids id versus more blanket selections in the challenge sheet on mtcars.
